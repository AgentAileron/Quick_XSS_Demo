# Quick_XSS_Demo
An awful and hacky XSS demo.

Uses modified older versions of Google.com, Cleverbot.com, Wordpress 2.11, [Prequel comic](prequeladventure.com) sourced from [The Wayback Machine](web.archive.org)

NB: reflected demo is technically DOM-Based because trying to make working PHP made me very sad. DOM refresh on page load used to simulate server constructing HTTP response.
